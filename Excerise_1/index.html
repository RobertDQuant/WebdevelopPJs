    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.</p>
    
    <h2>Brief history</h2>    
    <p>In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of hypertext, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on SGML. The IETF began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 Recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an ISO standard in 2000.
    <br>
    <br>
    At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML, prompting the founding of an independent group called WHATWG in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML5 continued: the two organizations released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in 2014.</p>

    <h2>Concept and syntax</h2>
    <p>An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing tags. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (<>). There are a few empty or void  tags that cannot enclose any text, for instance<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img" target="_blank"> &lt;img&gt;<img></a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can extend HTML tags with attributes, which provide additional information affecting how the browser interprets the element:</p>
